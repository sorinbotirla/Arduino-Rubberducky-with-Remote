# Arduino RubberDucky with Remote
Arduino Pro RubberDucky with Micro SD Card and NRF24 Remote.<br />
To get started, go to the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/sorinbotirla/Arduino-Rubberducky-with-Remote/wiki) <br />
<br /><br />
It features microSD ducky script reading, keystroke injection and dual NRF24 communication with support for acknowledgement of receiving the signals (you will get noticed on the remote if the signal was successfuly received by the rubberducky, so you won't send it multiple times by mistake). The remote features 3 buttons used to execute 3 scripts. The rubberducky features 1 button which manually triggers the execution of the script 1.
